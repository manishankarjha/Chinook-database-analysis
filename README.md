# Chinook-database-analysis

Analysing the CHINOOK music store database to answer various questions on sales, customer choices, best tracks etc. We have solved a total of 24 questions from basic to conventional questions and also found out some useful queries.

### Introduction

Firstly I have downloaded the dataset of Chinook Database named ``Chinook_PostgreSql`` from https://github.com/cwoodruff/ChinookDatabase under Scripts Folder and then to make columns and tables easily be queried by altering them all lowercase, I have made a ``chinook_fixer`` SQL file. After Running both files in ``mydb`` , I have cleared the space and start querying fresh for my Data Analytics project.
